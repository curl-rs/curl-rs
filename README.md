## Features
- Memory Safety Rust (Reduces buffer overflows, runtime race conditions)
- Built with Rust (Uses exisiting libraries like [Hyper][Hyper]) 
- No openssl needed, unless [rustls][Rustls] [doesn't supports it][RustlsSupport] for everything
- Built with modern features in mind with compatility for older features.
